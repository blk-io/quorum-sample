# Quorum Token Java Sample

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a private token on a Quorum network.
 
Quorum privacy is used, only certain members of the network are privy to the 
token that has been created.

It is written in Java using [web3j](https://web3j.io) which is maintained by 
[Web3 Labs](https://www.web3labs.com).


## Prerequisites

A Quorum network running with at least 3 transaction nodes.

You will need the following details for each node:
- Node URL, `http://<node-url>:<node-port>`
- Transaction enclave address, `<base64 encoded public key>`

## Running the application

You will need to update the 
[TokenApplication](src/main/java/com/web3labs/quorum/token/TokenApplication.java#L33) 
class with details of the URL for each of your transaction nodes and their associated public keys.

```java
// FIXME: Add node URL and transaction node keys here
Node nodeA = createAndUnlockAccount("nodeA", "http://<node-url>", "<transaction node key>");
Node nodeB = createAndUnlockAccount("nodeB", "http://<node-url>", "<transaction node key>");
Node nodeZ = createAndUnlockAccount("nodeZ", "http://<node-url>", "<transaction node key>");
```

Where your node url would be similar to `https://<app>.<yourdomain>.com:3200/{}` and 
the nodekey would be a base64 encoded public key such as 
`V4pb2lVRMwLZXGGmm/Ee3Y2U7BTlQ+BO8abrktMbSSQ=`.

Then to run the application, simply type:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The application logs the different activities it completes, which are as follows:

1. Create an Ethereum account on nodes A, B and Z.
1. Deploy a Quorum Token (symbol QT) contract that is visible only to nodes A, and B but not Z.
1. Transfer QT to accounts associated with nodes A, B, Z.
1. Display all account balances.
1. Demonstrate that node Z cannot see the QT assigned to its account.
1. Decrease the supply of QT.
1. Display all account balances.

There are also a couple of 
[integration tests](src/test/java/com/web3labs/quorum/token/TokenApplicationIT.java) 
you can use to test the application.

## Viewing contracts and transactions

The Web3 Labs blockchain explorer provides an easy to use UI for browsing transaction 
and contract details.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blk-io/epirus-free.git
cd epirus-free
NODE_ENDPOINT=http://<node-url> docker-compose up
```

You may access the blockchain explorer via http://localhost.

You can then browse the smart contract that was created by obtaining the token contract address, 
which is logged as follows:

```bash
19:53:10.853 [main] INFO  c.w.quorum.token.TokenApplication - Quorum Token (QT) created at contract address 0x<contract-address>, by account 0x<creation-account>
```

You can view the contract itself via the url `http://localhost:5000/contract/0x<contract-address>`:

You can also view the private transactions:

And details of those transactions:
